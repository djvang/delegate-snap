# Delegate Snap

This snap demonstrates how to develop a snap with TypeScript. It is a simple
snap that displays a confirmation dialog when the `hello` JSON-RPC method is
called.

## Steps to test

```
1. Open a [site](https://delegate-contracts-twa-web-snap.vercel.app/)
2. Authenticate via "Metamask Flask";
3. Allow "Web Notifications" to receive messages from the backend and send messages to "Metamask snap";
4. Create a contract (we recommend - Loan contract, as because it has the shortest quiz).
5. After the creation copy the share link and send it to second person.
6. Sign/reject contract by second person
7. See notification was sent via Metamask.
P.S. You can also check another notification such as: (decline, ask to change, etc)? for this you need to use such action.`
